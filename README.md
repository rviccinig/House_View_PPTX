# House_View_PPTX
Uses databank information to build automated presentations in pptx

- Change the name of the Databank File and the Uutput File Name in the config cell.
- Make Sure the databank is update and date cells match
- The template file pptx is called "Canadian Capital Markets House View - Q3 2021.pptx" out of pure laziness.... do not change that name or do it if you want...
- The presentations gets printed at the end of the pptx file. You have to close the slide master to seet
- Some charts represented as line charts are actually meant to be whiskers charts and you have to do the changes manually. Python pptx does not support whisker charts as of today.

NOTE:
* This file only does part of the Job! There formatting details that still need to be done to clean it up!
